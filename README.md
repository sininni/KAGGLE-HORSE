### Project Aim
In our project, we will work with Kaggle competition dataset for predicting horses' outcomes based on their health indicators. Our main goals are to find a model that would predict the outcomes of horses well enough (at least 75% accuracy on Kaggle) and try to classificate the instances of horses into meaningful groups that would help better understand horses' health conditions. 

Despite the fact that our dataset is a training one and its main goal is to give you the opportunity to practice your skills in Data Sience, a similar tasks be found in real life. For example, prediction models of such outcomes can be used by insurance companies for horses that are interested in the health status of each stallion during insurance to understand whether to provide insurance services for it and the probability of the animal's survival (e.g., the model could be used for decision on insurance based on the animal's mortality risk). This project won't only help us to practice the knowledge gained from the Data Science course, but also work on something that is applicable in real life. 

### Repository Contents
In the repository, you can find the Jupyter notebook with the code that we used for achieving our goals and all the needed explanaitions (you can also see it using the Colab link above); csv files with data that was used for the model training and testing ('train.csv' and 'test.csv'); our initial report. 

### Results Replication
To replicate the results from our code you can make a copy of our Colab notebook, download files 'train.csv' and 'test.csv' to the Colab environment, and run the notebook.
